# ~~Burn~~ Replace with your own after reading

This private repository is created for you so that your teachers have access to it.

## Identify yourself

Before anything, **complete the `metadata.yml` with your own information.** 

This is the file that we will use to identify the teacher responsible for the repository and assign the grades to the participating students.

## Take ownership

As long as you make sure to keep the `metadata.yml` file at the root of this repository, you are free to do anything. Our suggestion would be to have it organized into something like the following:

    .gitignore
    metadata.yml
    pom.xml
    README.md
    src/
      main/
      test/
    doc/
      uml/
      report.pdf

In particular, you will soon have to replace this README with something that describes your own project.
